## Development Setup
First, clone the repository and open the directory in GitHub Desktop. Enter the terminal and run the following command: ```npm install next```

## Running the Development Environment
Assuming the next install completed,
and all the necessary postgres configuration is setup, run the ```HFDB-API``` instance, then in the ```frontendext-nextjs``` terminal, type ```npm run dev``` to start the development environment. This will start the front end on port 3000, so navigate to ```http://localhost:3000/``` and you should end up on the landing page.

## Making edits in React
Once the page is running properly, you can edit on your site instance, and it will automatically rerender the page when you save any file relating to it. If it doesn't rerender you may need to save *all* the related files.
